# Drizzle ORM  
> Drizzle is a good friend who's there for you when necessary and doesn't bother when you need some space.

Drizzle ORM is a headless TypeScript ORM with a head üê≤

It looks and feels simple, performs on day _1000_ of your project, 
lets you do things your way, and is there when you need it.  

**It's the only ORM with both [relational](/docs/rqb) and [SQL-like](/docs/select) query APIs**, 
providing you best of both worlds when it comes to accessing your relational data. 
Drizzle is lightweight, performant, typesafe, non lactose, gluten-free, sober, flexible and **serverless-ready by design**.
Drizzle is not just a library, it's an experience ü§©

## Headless ORM? 
First and foremost, Drizzle is a library and a collection of complementary opt-in tools. 

**ORM** stands for _object relational mapping_, and developers tend to call Django-like or Spring-like tools an ORM. 
We trully believe it's a misconception based on legacy nomenclature and we call them **data frameworks**.

<Callout type="error" emoji="Ô∏èüíî">
  With data frameworks you have to build projects **around them** and not **with them**.
</Callout>

**Drizzle** lets you build your project the way you want, withour interfering with your project or structure. 

Using Drizzle you can define & manage database schemas in typescript, access your data in a SQL-like 
or relational way, and take advantage of opt in tools 
to push your developer experience _through the roof_ ü§Ø 

## Why SQL-like?
**If you know SQL ‚Äî you know Drizzle**.
  
Other ORMs and data frameworks tend to deviate/abstract you away from SQL which 
leads to a double learning curve ‚Äî needing to know both SQL and the framework's API.  
  
Drizzle is the opposite. 
We embrace SQL and built Drizzle to be SQL-like at its core, so you can have zero to none 
learning curve and access to the full power of SQL.  
  
We bring all the familiar **[SQL schema](/docs/sql-schema-declaration)**, **[queries](/docs/select)**, 
**[automatic migrations](/docs/migrations)** and **[one more thing](/docs/rqb)** ‚ú®

<CodeTabs items={["index.ts", "schema.ts", "migration.sql"]}>
```typescript copy
// Access your data
await db
	.select()
	.from(countries)
	.leftJoin(cities, eq(cities.countryId, countries.id))
	.where(eq(countries.id, 10))
```
```typescript copy
// manage your schema
export const countries = pgTable('countries', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: varchar('name', { length: 256 }),
});

export const cities = pgTable('cities', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: varchar('name', { length: 256 }),
  countryId: integer('country_id').references(() => countries.id),
});
```
```sql
-- generate migrations
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "countries" (
	"id" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar(256)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "cities" (
	"id" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar(256),
	"country_id" integer
);

ALTER TABLE "cities" ADD CONSTRAINT "cities_country_id_countries_id_fk" FOREIGN KEY ("country_id") REFERENCES "countries"("id") ON DELETE no action ON UPDATE no action;
```
</CodeTabs>

## Why not SQL-like?
We're always striving for a perfectly balanced solution, and while SQL-like does cover 100% of the needs, 
there're certain common scenarios where you can query data in a better way.  
  
We've built **[Queries API](/docs/rqb)** for you, so you can fetch relational nested data from the database 
in the most convenient and performant way, and never think about joins and data mapping.  
  
**Drizzle always outputs exactly 1 SQL query** ‚Äî feel free to use it with serverless databases and never worry about performance or roundtrip costs!

```ts
const result = await db.query.users.findMany({
	with: {
		posts: true
	},
});
```

## Serverless?
