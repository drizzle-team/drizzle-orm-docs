# Node MySQL 2 
According to their [official website](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2), 
`mysql2` is a MySQL client for Node.js with focus on performance.  

Drizzle ORM natively supports `mysql2` with `drizzle-orm/mysql2` package

There're two ways you can connect to the MySQL with `mysql2` driver - it's either single `client` connection or a `pool`.
For the built in `migrate` function with DDL migrations we and drivers strongly encourage you to use single `client` connection.  
For querying purposes feel free to use either `client` or `pool` based on your business demands.
