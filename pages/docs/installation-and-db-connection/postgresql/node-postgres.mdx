## node-postgres
According to their [official website](https://node-postgres.com/), node-postgres is a collection 
of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database  

Drizzle ORM natively supports `pg` with `drizzle-orm/pg` package

There're two ways you can connect to the PostgreSQL with `pg` driver - it's either single `client` connection or a `pool`.
For the built in `migrate` function with DDL migrations we and drivers are strongly encourage you to use single `client` connection.  
For querying purposes feel free to use either `client` or `pool` based on your business demands.
