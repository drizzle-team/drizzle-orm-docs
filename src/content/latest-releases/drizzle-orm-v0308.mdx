## New Features

- Added custom schema support to enums in Postgres (fixes [#669](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/669) via [#2048](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/2048)):

```ts copy {3,4}
import { pgSchema } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

const mySchema = pgSchema('mySchema');
const colors = mySchema.enum('colors', ['red', 'green', 'blue']);
```

## Fixes

- Changed D1 `migrate()` function to use batch API ([#2137](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/2137))

To get started with Drizzle and D1 follow the [documentation](/docs/get-started-sqlite#cloudflare-d1).

- Split `where` clause in Postgres `.onConflictDoUpdate` method into `setWhere` and `targetWhere` clauses, to support both `where` cases in `on conflict ...` clause (fixes [#1628](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1628), [#1302](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1302) via [#2056](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/2056)).

- Fixed query generation for `where` clause in Postgres `.onConflictDoNothing` method, as it was placed in a wrong spot (fixes [#1628](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1628) via [#2056](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/2056)).

- Fixed multiple issues with AWS Data API driver (fixes [#1931](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/1931), [#1932](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1932), [#1934](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1934), [#1936](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1936) via [#2119](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/2119))
- Fix inserting and updating array values in AWS Data API (fixes [#1912](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1912) via [#1911](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/1911))
