# Drizzle extension for Prisma

If you have an existing project with Prisma and want to try Drizzle or gradually adopt it,
you can use our first-class extension that will add Drizzle API to your Prisma client. It will allow you to
use Drizzle alongside your Prisma queries reusing your existing DB connection.

## How to use

### Approach 1 - using Prisma as DB driver
The approach supports PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite but has some limitations with Drizzle ORM features support

<Steps>
#### Install dependencies

You need to install Drizzle itself and a generator package that will create Drizzle schema from the Prisma schema.
<Npm>
drizzle-orm@latest
-D drizzle-prisma-generator
</Npm>

#### Update your Prisma schema

Add Drizzle generator to your Prisma schema. `output` is the path where generated Drizzle schema TS files will be placed.
```prisma copy filename="schema.prisma" {5-8}
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

generator drizzle {
  provider = "drizzle-prisma-generator"
  output   = "./drizzle" // Where to put generated Drizle tables
}

// Rest of your Prisma schema

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DB_URL")
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}

...
```

#### Generate Drizzle schema

```bash
prisma generate
```

#### Add Drizzle extension to your Prisma client

<CodeTabs items={["PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "SQLite"]}>
<CodeTab>
```ts copy
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/prisma/pg';

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(drizzle());
```
</CodeTab>
<CodeTab>
```ts copy
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/prisma/mysql';

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(drizzle());
```
</CodeTab>
<CodeTab>
```ts copy
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/prisma/sqlite';

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(drizzle());
```
</CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

#### Run Drizzle queries via `prisma.$drizzle` ✨

In order to use Drizzle query builder, you need references to Drizzle tables.
You can import them from the output path that you specified in the generator config.

```ts copy
import { User } from './drizzle';

await prisma.$drizzle.insert().into(User).values({ email: 'sorenbs@drizzle.team', name: 'Søren' });
const users = await prisma.$drizzle.select().from(User);
```

</Steps>

## Limitations

- [Relational queries](/docs/rqb) are not supported due to a [Prisma driver limitation](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17576). Because of it, Prisma unable to return query results in array format, which is required for relational queries to work.
- In SQLite, `.values()` (e.g. `await db.select().from(table).values()`) is not supported, because of the same reason as above.
- [Prepared statements](/docs/perf-queries#prepared-statement) support is limited - `.prepare()` will only build the SQL query on Drizzle side, because there is no Prisma API for prepared queries.
- Prisma native type annotations currently are not supported.

### Approach 2 - using third party DB drivers
Prisma has experimental feature which allows to use third party DB drivers instead the built-in drivers via so-called "adapters".

The approach has slight advantages over the previous one: it supports all Drizzle ORM/Query builder features such as Relational Queries and Prepared Statements,
but supports limited number of databases (MySQL is not supported)

<Steps>
  #### Install dependencies

  You need to install Drizzle itself and a generator package that will create Drizzle schema from the Prisma schema.
  <Npm>
    drizzle-orm@latest
    -D drizzle-prisma-generator
  </Npm>

  #### Install DB driver

  Currently Prisma supports only these DB drivers as external adapters: `d1`, `libsql`, `neon`, `pg-worker`, `pg`, `planetscale`.
  For more details for each of these see [Prisma packages](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/tree/main/packages)

  In these example we will use `pg`

  <CodeTabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    <CodeTab>
      ```bash
      npm i pg @prisma/adapter-pg
      npm i -D @types/pg
      ```
    </CodeTab>
    <CodeTab>
      ```bash
      yarn add pg @prisma/adapter-pg
      yarn add -D @types/pg
      ```
    </CodeTab>
    <CodeTab>
      ```bash
      pnpm add pg @prisma/adapter-pg
      pnpm add -D @types/pg
      ```
    </CodeTab>
    <CodeTab>
      ```bash
      bun add pg @prisma/adapter-pg
      bun add -D @types/pg
      ```
    </CodeTab>
  </CodeTabs>

  #### Update your Prisma schema

  Add Drizzle generator to your Prisma schema. `output` is the path where generated Drizzle schema TS files will be placed.
  ```prisma copy filename="schema.prisma" {3-8}
  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
    previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"] // Required to share same DB driver with Prisma
  }

  generator drizzle {
    provider = "drizzle-prisma-generator"
    output   = "./drizzle" // Where to put generated Drizle tables
  }

  // Rest of your Prisma schema

  datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DB_URL")
}

  model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}

  ...
  ```

  #### Generate Drizzle schema

  ```bash
  prisma generate
  ```

  #### Initialize DB clients

  ```ts copy
  import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
  import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg';
  import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/prisma/pg';
  import pg, { Pool } from 'pg';

  const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DB_URL });
  const adapter = new PrismaPg(pool);
  const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter });
  const dbDrizzle = drizzle({ client: pool });

  ```

  #### Run Drizzle queries via `dbDrizzle` ✨

  In order to use Drizzle query builder, you need references to Drizzle tables.
  You can import them from the output path that you specified in the generator config.

  ```ts copy
  import { User } from './drizzle';

  await dbDrizzle.insert().into(User).values({ email: 'sorenbs@drizzle.team', name: 'Søren' });
  const users = await dbDrizzle.select().from(User);
  ```

</Steps>

## Limitations

- Prisma native type annotations currently are not supported.
- Limited number of DB drivers supported by Prisma Adapters.
