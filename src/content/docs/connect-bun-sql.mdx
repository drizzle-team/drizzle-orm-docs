# Drizzle \<\> Bun SQL

<Prerequisites>
- Database [connection basics](/docs/connect-overview) with Drizzle
- Bun - [website](https://bun.sh/docs)
- Bun SQL - native bindings for working with PostgreSQL databases - [read here](https://bun.sh/docs/api/sql)
</Prerequisites>

According to the **[official website](https://bun.sh/)**, Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. 

Drizzle ORM natively supports **[`bun sql`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/sql)** module and it's crazy fast ðŸš€  

<Callout type='error'>
In version `1.2.0`, Bun has issues with executing concurrent statements, which may lead to errors if you try to run several queries simultaneously.
We've created a [github issue](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/16774) that you can track. Once it's fixed, you should no longer encounter any such errors on Bun's SQL side
</Callout>

#### Step 1 - Install packages
<Npm>
drizzle-orm
-D drizzle-kit
</Npm>

#### Step 2 - Initialize the driver and make a query
```typescript copy
import 'dotenv/config';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/bun-sql';

const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

const result = await db.select().from(...);
```

If you need to provide your existing driver:
```typescript copy
import 'dotenv/config';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/bun-sql';
import { SQL } from 'bun';

const client = new SQL(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
const db = drizzle({ client });
```
