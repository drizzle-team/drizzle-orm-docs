# Upgrading to Drizzle v1 RC

<Prerequisites>
  - **beta.1** release notes - a set of changes between `latest` and `beta` versions - [read here](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/blob/beta/changelogs/drizzle-orm/1.0.0-beta.1.md)
  - **beta.2** release notes - additional set of changes between `latest` and `beta` versions - [read here](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.2)
  - Ideally read all other `beta.X` changes to be familiar with everything that was fixed and changed
</Prerequisites>

Drizzle release candidate is living on [`beta` branch](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/tree/beta) in drizzle repository and under the `beta` tag on npm. So to install
it you would need to run:

<Npm>
drizzle-orm@beta
-D drizzle-kit@beta
</Npm>

It follows the `1.0.0-beta.x` release pattern, so you'll see versions such as `1.0.0-beta.7`, `1.0.0-beta.8`, and so on. 
Release notes for each beta update are available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/tags)

#### Step 1 - Run `drizzle-kit up`

> Linked discussion: https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/discussions/2832

We've updated the migrations folder structure by:
- removing `journal.json`
- grouping SQL files and snapshots into separate migration folders
- removing the `drizzle-kit drop` command

These changes eliminate potential Git conflicts with the journal file and simplify the process of dropping or fixing conflicted migrations

In upcoming `beta` releases, we'll introduce commutativity checks to help guide you through team migration conflicts, detect possible collisions, and suggest ways to resolve them
> Commutativity discussion: https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/discussions/5005

To migrate previous folders to a new format you would need to run

<Npx>
drizzle-kit up
</Npx>

#### Step 2 - Update validator packages imports

We've stopped maintaining separate validator packages (e.g., `drizzle-zod`, `drizzle-valibot`) and moved them into the `drizzle-orm` repo. This consolidates everything into a single package and eliminates the need to manage separate peer dependencies and versioning.

All packages are now available via `drizzle-orm` imports:

- `drizzle-zod` -> `drizzle-orm/zod`
- `drizzle-valibot` -> `drizzle-orm/valibot`
- `drizzle-typebox` -> `drizzle-orm/typebox-legacy` (using `@sinclair/typebox`)
- `drizzle-typebox` -> `drizzle-orm/typebox` (using `typebox`)
- `drizzle-arktype` -> `drizzle-orm/arktype`

#### Step 3 - Update Relational Queries to v2

We've explained all the RQBv2 changes in detail, along with options for updating your codebase:

- [How to migrate relations definition from v1 to v2](/docs/relations-v1-v2#how-to-migrate-relations-schema-definition-from-v1-to-v2)  
- [How to migrate queries from v1 to v2](/docs/relations-v1-v2#how-to-migrate-queries-from-v1-to-v2)  
- [Partial upgrade, or how to stay on v1 even after an upgrade?](/docs/relations-v1-v2#partial-upgrade-or-how-to-stay-on-rqb-v1-even-after-an-upgrade)  

#### Step 3 - Done ✅
