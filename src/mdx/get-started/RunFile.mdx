To run any TypeScript files, you have several options, but let's stick with one: using `tsx`

You've already installed `tsx`, so we can run our queries now

**Run `index.ts` script**
<Npx>
  tsx src/index.ts
</Npx>

<Callout title='tips'>
  We suggest using `bun` to run TypeScript files. With `bun`, such scripts can be executed without issues or additional 
  settings, regardless of whether your project is configured with CommonJS (CJS), ECMAScript Modules (ESM), or any other module format. 
  To run a script with `bun`, use the following command:
  ```bash copy
  bun src/index.ts
  ```

  If you don't have bun installed, check the [Bun installation docs](https://bun.sh/docs/installation#installing)
