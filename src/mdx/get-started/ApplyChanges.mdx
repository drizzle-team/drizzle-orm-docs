You can directly apply changes to your database using the `drizzle-kit push` command. This is a convenient method for quickly testing new schema designs or modifications in a local development environment, allowing for rapid iterations without the need to manage migration files:

```bash copy
npx drizzle-kit push
```

Read more about the push command in [documentation](/docs/drizzle-kit-push).

Alternatively, you can generate migrations using the `drizzle-kit generate` command and then apply them using the `drizzle-kit migrate` command:

Generate migrations:
```bash copy
npx drizzle-kit generate
```

Apply migrations:
```bash copy
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```
